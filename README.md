Datawarehouse design for Pharmaceutical sales and Health Indicators affecting obesity, heart diseases and cancer

PHARMACEUTICAL SALES DATAWAREHOUSE DESIGN AND ANALYSIS

Problem Setting :
Pharmacy is one of the main components of a thriving human civilization and is extremely important
to the standard of living and defines the health and sanitation of the country or city. Hence it is
extremely important that medicines are in the right hands and is distributed extremely efficiently
across a vast range of networks. A database for a Pharmacy is an extremely efficient and an
important tool in maintaining is distribution network. In this particular problem, we will see how to
create a database and a multidimensional schema for a company called Glenn Pharma responsible
for supplying medicines across Massachussetts.
Problem Definition :
This project intends to build the database design of a business model similar to a Pharmaceutical
database. Keeping extensibility and scalability in mind, we will build a module that can be converted
to a microservice architecture or transferred to a data warehouse to perform data analysis for the
prediction of future trends in technologies. The transformed data is loaded in a data warehouse
where analysis is done. A few of the analysis topics are mentioned below:
1. What drug generates the maximum revenue
2. Who are the top performing salesmen?
3. Who are the biggest customers?
4. What is the monthly sales analysis.


Data :
The data is collected from the database of a Pharmaceutical company called Glenn Pharma and it is
found on dataworld.org. It contains the details about the meetings held between salesmen and
customers, the salesmen, the sutomers and the products which the company is currently dealing
with.


Data Description :
The meeting table contains the record of 2585 meetings held between customers and the sales
representatives and also gives and information of the amount of sales intended for that meeting and
whether the sale was converted or not. The product table contains a list of 30 products with each
sales rep responsible for one product respectively. The customer table contains a list of all the
customers and their contact information which will be useful to sales reps. We also have the
inventory table which gives a list of all the products and their quantities which are stored in the data
warehouse.


END GOAL :
Our end goal in this project is to create a multidimensional model of the pharmaceutical database
which will be useful for further analysis.

HEALTH INDICATORS AFFECTING OBESITY, HEART DISEASES AND CANCER ANALYSIS

PROBLEM SETTING
Obesity increases the risk of several debilitating, and deadly diseases, including diabetes,
heart disease, and some cancers. It does this through a variety of pathways, some as
straightforward as the mechanical stress of carrying extra pounds and some involving
complex changes in hormones and metabolism. There are many reasons why some people
have difficulty losing weight. Usually, obesity results from inherited, physiological and
environmental factors, combined with diet, physical activity and exercise choices. In this
project, Community Health Status Indicators (CHSI) to combat obesity, heart disease, and
cancer are major components of the Community Health Data Initiative. The selected
dataset provides key health indicators for local communities and encourages dialogue about
actions that can be taken to improve community health (e.g., obesity, heart disease, cancer).
The health indicators are an important discussion to empower health consciousness and
spread awareness about the ill effects of obesity and factors that cause the same.

PROBLEM DEFINITION
Community Health Status Indicators (CHSI) to combat obesity, heart disease, and cancer
are major components of the Community Health Data Initiative. The dataset provides key
health indicators for local communities and encourages dialogue about actions that can be
taken to improve community health (e.g., obesity, heart disease, cancer). The CHSI report
and dataset was designed not only for public health professionals but also for members of
the community who are interested in the health of their community. The CHSI report
contains over 200 measures for each of the 3,141 United States counties. Although CHSI
presents indicators like deaths due to heart disease and cancer, it is imperative to understand
that behavioral factors such as obesity, tobacco use, diet, physical activity, alcohol and
drug use, sexual behavior and others substantially contribute to these deaths.
Our team is challenged to undertake research or analysis on this data and submit the
findings. This project's purpose is to use data engineering and warehousing concepts to
build data pipelines that receive data from a source, transform it, and store it in the best
possible format for data visualization and to derive actionable and scalable insights from
the data. We are trying to answer the following questions:
• What are the major factors leading to obesity, heart diseases and cancer?
• What is the reason behind largest number of deaths?
• Top few factors of health illness in people?
• What are some ways to improve mortality rate due to these health conditions?
